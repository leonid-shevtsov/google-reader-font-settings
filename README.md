# Google Reader font settings 

The default typography of Google Reader sucks enormously. So I made this extension
that can change the font settings for articles, akin to Readability for web pages.

Settings that can be changed in this version:

* Font face
* Font size
* Line height
* Text width
* Text alignment

I'm thinking about:

* setting the header font, monospace font, etc
* changing the color scheme

* * *
