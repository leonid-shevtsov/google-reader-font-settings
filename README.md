# Google Reader font settings

![Screenshot](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/google-reader-font-settings/raw/master/screenshot.png)

The default typography of Google Reader sucks enormously. So I made this extension
that can change the font settings for articles, akin to Readability for web pages.

Settings that can be changed in this version:

* Font face
* Font size
* Line height
* Text width
* Text alignment

I'm thinking about:

* setting the header font, monospace font, etc
* changing the color scheme

## Installation

[Get it fro the Google Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bdmnfdhcffbdbpfnjocdbgbgeadapieg). Then go to the extension's Options page and modify whatever you want.

## Changelog

* 2012-05-19 0.2
  * Added presets, added welcome notice, enable some settings by default

* 2012-05-19 0.12
  * Initial release

* * *
